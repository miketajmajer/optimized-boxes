# Boxes
Python Project to find an optimum solution to fill a box with other boxes
A python project to use as a template when developing a Python application.

# Requirements

Assessment: Optimization (open-ended solution) and optional

You need a fairly optimal way to bunch of small boxes into a big box.  It doesn't need to be perfect, as coming up with a provably optimal solution is likely a really hard problem.

The input is a text file with a listing of integer volumes(width, length, height).  The first line is the container volume, the rest are the volumes of boxes to be placed inside.

Place as many as you can.

Output the best configuration you find to optimize the number of boxes put into the container, and/or the configuration that most fully utilizes the space within the container.

If you write in a low-level language, you can use a library for basic data structures
